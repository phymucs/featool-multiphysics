% 
% 
% System Requirements
% -------------------
% 
% The _FEATool Multiphysics_ Toolbox can either be used stand-alone as a
% fully integrated simulation GUI, or together with MATLAB enabling
% command line (CLI) use and scripting. In order to use the _FEATool
% Multiphysics_ toolbox, the program files must first be installed on the
% intended computer system. Please follow the procedure below for the
% corresponding stand-alone or MATLAB toolbox installation modes. Note
% that it is recommended to first uninstall older versions of _FEATool_
% before updating to a newer version.
% 
% 
% Stand-alone Toolbox
% -------------------
% 
% FEATool Multiphysics has been compiled to run in stand-alone mode
% together with the freely available MCR runtime (does not require
% MATLAB). Stand-alone mode is supported for 64-bit Windows systems (and
% virtual machines VMs) with 4 GB or more RAM memory.
% 
% To install, download the installer from link below and run it. The
% installer will automatically download and install the correct MCR
% runtime engine (>=1 GB file size) and then install the FEATool
% executable. Click on the FEATool icon after the installation has been
% completed to start the toolbox.<br><br>
% 
% [![FEATool Multiphysics - Stand-Alone Toolbox Download](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/multiphysics/files/1.11.1/FEATool_Multiphysics_webinstaller.exe/download)<br>
% 
% Please note that as the MCR runtime is quite slow to start, the
% _FEATool_ GUI may take some minutes to show up after the initial
% splash screen has disappeared.
% 
% 
% MATLAB Toolbox
% --------------
% 
% If you have MATLAB, the _FEATool_ toolbox can also be installed directly
% from the MATLAB APPS and Add-On Toolbar, the MathWorks File Exchange,
% or downloaded directly from the link below.
% 
% _FEATool Multiphysics_ has been verified work with 64-bit Windows, Mac
% OSX, and Linux operating systems running MATLAB versions 7.9 (R2009b)
% and later. Furthermore, a system with 4 GB or more RAM memory is
% recommended.
% 
% ### Installation with MATLAB
% 
% - For MATLAB 2012b and later double click on the **FEATool Multiphysics.mlappinstall**
%   file, or use the _Get More Apps_ button in the MATLAB _APPS_
%   toolbar. Once the app has been installed, a corresponding icon will
%   be available in the toolbar to start _FEATool_. (Note that MATLAB
%   may not show or give any indication of the app installation progress
%   or completion.)
% 
% - For MATLAB 2009b-2012a, use the _addpath_ command to add the
%   extracted _featool_ program directory to the MATLAB search paths, so
%   that the program files can be found by the interpreter (for example
%   `addpath C:\featool`). Then simply enter the command `featool` at
%   the MATLAB command prompt to start the toolbox GUI and application.
% 
% Please note, that using spaces in user and installation directory
% paths is not recommended as it can potentially cause issues with
% interfaces to external tools, such as geometry engines, grid
% generation, and external solvers. Moreover, as all functions are
% initially loaded into memory, _FEATool_ may take some time to load and
% show the GUI on initial startup.
% 
% 
% Tutorials and Examples
% ----------------------
% 
% Pre-defined automated modeling tutorials and examples for various
% multi-physics applications can be selected and run from the **File** >
% **Model Examples and Tutorials** menu option. Example m-script files
% and simulation models are also available in the _examples folder_ of
% the _FEATool_ program directory. Moreover, more tutorials and articles
% are published on the
% [FEATool Technical Articles Blog](https://www.featool.com/articles).
% 
% 
% Documentation
% -------------
% 
% The full
% [FEATool Multiphysics Documentation Suite](https://www.featool.com/doc)
% is available online and from selecting the corresponding option under
% the _Help_ menu in the _FEATool_ GUI.
% 
% 
% Basic Use
% ---------
% 
% _FEATool_ and its GUI has been specifically designed to be as easy to
% use as possible, and making learning multiphysics simulation by
% experimentation possible.
% 
% The standard modeling process is divided into six different steps or modes
% 
% - **Geometry** - Definition of the geometry to be modeled
% - **Grid** - Subdivision of the geometry into smaller cells suitable
%   for computation
% - **Equation** - Specification of material parameters and coefficients
% - **Boundary** - Boundary conditions specify how the model interacts
%   with the surrounding environment (outside the geometry)
% - **Solve** - Solution and simulation of the defined model problem
% - **Post** - Visualization and postprocessing of simulation results
% 
% These modes can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding buttons
% in left hand side _Mode_ toolbar. The different modes may have
% specialized and different _Tools_ available in the corresponding
% toolbar. Advanced mode options may also be available in the
% corresponding menus.
% 
% Basic usage and how to set up and model laminar flow past a cylinder
% is explained in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZnnXl7ryBMI"
% target="_blank">linked video tutorial</a> (click on the image to view
% the tutorial).
%

% </a></p>
% 
% The _FEATool_ installation can be tested and validated by running the
% simulation model and example test suites by starting _FEATool_ with
% either of these commands
% 
%     featool testt    % Run tests for GUI tutorials
%     featool teste    % Run tests for m-script examples
%     featool test     % Run all test suites
% 
% Please note that running the test suites may take a significant
% amount of time.
% 
% 
% External Solvers (_Optional_)
% -----------------------------
% 
% ### OpenFOAM® CFD Solver
% 
% The optional OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics solver integration
% makes it easy to perform both laminar and turbulent high performance
% CFD simulations directly in MATLAB. OpenFOAM flow simulations often
% results in a magnitude or more speedup for instationary simulations
% compared to the built-in flow solvers. Additionally, with the
% multi-simulation solver integration in _FEATool_ it is possible to
% compare and better validate simulation results obtained using both the
% built-in, FEniCS, Firedrake, and OpenFOAM solvers.
% 
% The OpenFOAM solver binaries are not included with the _FEATool_
% distribution and must be installed separately. The FEATool-OpenFOAM
% solver integration has been verified with OpenFOAM version 5. For
% Windows systems it is recommended to install and use the pre-compiled
% blueCFD-core (2017) binaries from
% [blueCAPE](http://bluecfd.github.io/Core). For Linux and MacOS systems
% the distribution from the
% [OpenFOAM Foundation](https://openfoam.org/download) is
% recommended. It is necessary that the _simpleFoam_, _pimpleFoam_,
% _rhoCentralFoam_, _potentialFoam_, and _collapseEdges_ binaries are
% installed and properly set up so they can be called from system script
% files (bash scripts on Linux and MacOS and bat/vbs on Windows).
% 
% 
% ### SU2 CFD Solver
% 
% Along with OpenFOAM, [SU2](https://su2code.github.io) is one of the
% leading and most popular academic research and open-source CFD
% solvers. The SU2 code was initially developed for compressible flows
% and aerodynamic shape optimization and but has been extended to handle
% a wide range of flow problems. FEATool includes the SU2 CFD solver,
% and features easy and convenient GUI and CLI interfaces. This allows
% SU2 to be used as a solver for both laminar and turbulent
% incompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible inviscid Euler flow
% problems.
% 
% 
% ### FEniCS and Firedrake PDE Solvers
% 
% [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org) and
% [Firedrake](https://firedrakeproject.org/) are flexible and
% comprehensive finite element analysis (FEA) and partial differential
% equation (PDE) modeling and simulation toolkit with Python and C++
% interfaces along with many integrated solvers. As both _FEATool_ and
% FEniCS discretize equations employing a weak finite element
% formulation it is quite straightforward to translate _FEATool_ syntax
% and convert it to Python scripts. The FEATool-FEniCS/Firedrake
% integration allows for easy conversion, exporting, solving, and
% importing _FEATool Multiphysics_ models to FEniCS and Firedrake
% directly from the GUI, as well as the MATLAB CLI.
% 
% For Ubuntu based Linux and Windows 10 with
% [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)
% systems, FEniCS can be installed by opening a terminal shell and
% running the following commands (which automatically also installs
% required dependencies such as the Python programming language
% interpreter)
% 
%     sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
%     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics
%     sudo apt-get update
%     sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends fenics
% 
% Note that the _FEATool_ distribution does not include a Python
% interpreter, FEniCS, or Firedrake itself which also must be installed
% separately.  The FEniCS homepage provides instructions
% [how to install FEniCS on Linux systems](https://fenicsproject.org/download/)
% (note that Docker images are currently not supported by _FEATool_).
% 
% 
% External Grid Generators (_Optional_)
% -------------------------------------
% 
% _FEATool Multiphysics_ comes with built-in support for the external
% grid and mesh generators [_Gmsh_](http://gmsh.info/), _Gridgen2D_
% (included), and
% [_Triangle_](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html), upon
% selecting any of these grid generators in the _Grid Settings_ dialog
% box, the corresponding binaries will automatically be downloaded and
% installed if an internet connection is available. Alternatively, the
% mesh generator binaries can downloaded from the
% [external grid generators repository](https://github.com/precise-simulation/external-grid-generators)
% and/or compiled manually and added to the _FEATool_ installation
% directory.
% 
% Advantages of using either _Gmsh_, _Gridgen2D_, or _Triangle_ compared
% to the built-in grid generation functions is both robustness and mesh
% generation speed. Moreover, external grid generators also supports
% better and more control with a selection of different mesh generation
% algorithms, and specifying the grid size in different geometry
% regions, subdomains, as well as on boundaries, allowing for greater
% flexibility and better grids tuned for the specific problems and
% geometries.
% 
% In addition to the external grid generator interfaces, _FEATool_ also
% fully supports mesh import and export from the Dolfin/FEniCS (XML),
% [GiD](https://www.gidhome.com),
% [General Mesh Viewer](http://www.generalmeshviewer.com) (GMV), and
% [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org) (VTK/VTP) formats.
